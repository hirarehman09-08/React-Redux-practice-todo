------------- Without combined-Reducer ------------------


import todosReducer from './features/todos/todosSlice'
import filtersReducer from './features/filters/filtersSlice'

export default function rootReducer(state = {}, action) {
  // always return a new object for the root state
  return {
    // the value of `state.todos` is whatever the todos reducer returns
    todos: todosReducer(state.todos, action),
    // For both reducers, we only pass in their slice of the state
    filters: filtersReducer(state.filters, action)
  }
}


---------------With Combined-Reducer ------------
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'

import todosReducer from './features/todos/todosSlice'
import filtersReducer from './features/filters/filtersSlice'

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  todos: todosReducer,
  filters: filtersReducer,
})
export default rootReducer
